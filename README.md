## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

The challenge I found with this project was configuring a separate popup for desktop vs mobile when clicking the share button.  It was good to continue to work on layouts and javascript dom maniuplation.

### Continued development

I plan on using CSS Grid in my next project.  I want to learn how and when to use CSS Grid vs Flexbox.  Each has its own advantages and disadvantages and I'm sure will be useful for particular use cases.
